# 100 Days of Code – Python Bootcamp

This repository documents my progress through the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

## 🧠 About the Challenge

The course is designed to help you master Python by building 100 projects in 100 days. It covers a wide range of topics including:

- Python fundamentals and object-oriented programming
- Automation with Selenium and BeautifulSoup
- Web development with Flask
- Data science and machine learning with Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and more
- Game development, GUIs, and APIs

## 🚧 My Progress

I'm currently on **Day 16**, learning about **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. Each day’s work is stored in its own folder, and includes scripts, notebooks, or notes depending on the topic.

## 📌 Notes

While the course covers many areas, my long-term focus is on **environmental data analysis**. I’m complementing this challenge with other resources like Think Stats, Python for Data Analysis, and libraries such as `xarray`, `cartopy`, and `metpy`.
