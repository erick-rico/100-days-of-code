# 100 Days of Code – Python Bootcamp

This repository documents my personal progress through the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu.

## 🧠 About the Challenge

The course is designed to help learners master Python by building 100 projects in 100 days. It covers a wide range of topics including:

- Python fundamentals and object-oriented programming
- Automation with Selenium and BeautifulSoup
- Web development with Flask
- Data science and machine learning with Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and more
- Game development, GUIs, and APIs

## 🚧 My Progress

I'm currently on **Day 16**, learning about **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. Each day's work is stored in its own folder and includes my own solutions and extra practice scripts.
